   abstract = {In the MEG II experiment, Multi-Pixel Photon Counters (MPPC) sensitive to vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light are used in the liquid xenon gamma-ray detector under a high-intensity muon beam environment. In the commissioning phase of the detector with the beam, a significant degradation in the Photon Detection Efficiency (PDE) for VUV light was observed, while the degradation in the PDE for visible light was much less significant. This wavelength dependence of the damage level suggests that the radiation damage is localized to the surface of the MPPC where incoming VUV photons create electron–hole pairs. The study also found that the original PDE level could be restored by thermal annealing.},

Scintillating tiles are read out via wavelength-shifting fibers that guide the scintillation light to a novel photodetector, the silicon photomultiplier. A prototype has been tested using a positron test beam at DESY. The results are compared with a reference prototype calorimeter equipped with multichannel vacuum photomultipliers. Detector calibration, noise, linearity and stability are discussed, and the energy response in a 1-6 GeV positron beam is compared with simulations. The present results demonstrate that the silicon photomultiplier is well-suited as photodetectors in calorimeters and thus has been selected for the construction of a 1m3 calorimeter prototype to operate in hadron beams. © 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {A large-area Multi-Pixel Photon Counter (MPPC) sensitive to vacuum ultra violet (VUV) light has been developed for the liquid xenon (LXe) scintillation detector of the MEG II experiment. The LXe detector is designed to detect the 52.8MeV photon from the lepton flavour violating decay μ + →e + γ and is based on 900ℓ LXe with a highly granular scintillation readout by 4092 VUV-MPPCs with an active area of 139mm 2 each, totalling 0.57m 2 . The VUV-MPPC shows an excellent performance in LXe, which includes a high photon detection efficiency (PDE) up to 21% for the LXe scintillation light in the VUV range, a high gain, a low probability of the optical cross-talk and the after-pulsing, a low dark count rate and a good single photoelectron resolution. The large active area of the VUV-MPPC is formed by connecting four independent small VUV-MPPC chips in series to avoid the increase of the sensor capacitance and thus, to have a short pulse-decay-time, which is crucial for high rate experiments. Performance tests of 4180 VUV-MPPCs produced for the LXe detector were also carried out at room temperature prior to the installation to the detector and all of them with only a few exceptions were found to work properly. The design and performance of the VUV-MPPC are described in detail as well as the results from the performance tests at room temperature.},

Since a muon beam rate is $3\text\{-\}5 \times 10^\{7\}~\text\{s\}^\{-1\}$, multi-photon elimination analysis is performed using waveform analysis techniques such as a template waveform fit. As a result, background events in the energy range of 48-58 MeV were reduced by 34 %.

   abstract = {Scintillation from liquid rare gases has a fast decay component with a high photon yield which is comparable to that of NaI(Tl), although the wavelength is in the vacuum ultraviolet. On the basis of these properties, many investigators have tried to realize liquid rare gas scintillation detector. In particular, liquid Xe is expected to be an excellent detector medium for-rays because of its fast response, its large atomic number, and high density. However, it is very difficult to achieve sufficient light collection as scintillator, because the light emission is in the vacuum ultraviolet. Recently, some groups have reported liquid Xe/Kr homogeneous scintillation calorimeters for high-energy-rays using reflectors method, but their energy resolution was not as high as expected. In this situation it seems that the realization of liquid rare gas detectors may not be easy. In this paper, we review the physical properties of scintillation from liquid rare gas, the scintillation yields, the decay time constants and attenuation lengths. We summarize the results obtained with liquid rare gas scintillation detector. The present status of development of liquid Kr/Xe homogeneous scintillation calorimeters by using reflected light is described. A new device which observes only direct light is proposed as high-energy-ray detector or homogeneous electromagnetic shower calorimeters for-rays.},

Radiation damage in silicon sensors is briefly introduced, surface and bulk effects are separately addressed. Results on the operation of irradiated SiPMs with X-ray, gamma, electron, proton and neutron sources are presented. The most critical effect of radiation on SiPMs is the increase of dark count rate, which makes it impossible to resolve signals generated by a single photon from the noise. Methods to characterize irradiated SiPMs after their single photo-electron resolution is lost are discussed. Due to the important similarity in the operation below the breakdown voltage, studies on radiation damage of avalanche photo-diodes (APD) are also reviewed.

The data exhibit a zenith angle dependent deficit of muon neutrinos which is inconsistent with expectations based on calculations of the atmospheric neutrino flux. Experimental biases and uncertainties in the prediction of neutrino fluxes and cross sections are unable to explain our observation. The data are consistent, however, with two-flavor n m $ n t oscillations with sin 2 2u. 0.82 and 5 3 10 24 , Dm 2 , 6 3 10 23 eV 2 at 90% confidence level. [S0031-9007(98)06975-0] PACS numbers: 14.60.Pq, 96.40.Tv Atmospheric neutrinos are produced as decay products in hadronic showers resulting from collisions of cosmic rays with nuclei in the upper atmosphere.

The importance of rare muon processes with lepton flavor violation is highly stressed, together with precision measurements of normal muon decay. Recent up-to-date motivations of lepton flavor violation based on supersymmetric models, in particular supersymmetric grand unified theories , are described along with other theoretical models. Future prospects of experiments and muon sources of high intensity for further progress in this field are also discussed.},

This experiment searches for the lepton-flavour violating decay μ +→e+γ with a sensitivity down to 10 -13. The first prototype of the chip contains 768 capacitive sampling cells fabricated in a 0.25 μm CMOS process. Sampling takes place with an on-chip generated frequency ranging up to 2.5 GHz. The cells are read out at 40 MHz with an external 12 bit flash ADC. The design of the chip is described and test results from the first prototype are reported. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Publisher Summary
The mass spectrometer portion of the gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) is a complex device and must be treated with a great deal of care. Instrument performance is important and must be verified regularly. The quality of the data must be verified, and regular maintenance of the instrument is important. In gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), the mass spectrometer ionizes the gas-phase eluate from the GC column as it enters the mass spectrometer. The data resulting from a GC/MS analysis are known as ‘mass spectra.’ Mass spectra are acquired one after another at a consistent rate. Mass spectrometer must be operated at a very low pressure, i.e., a vacuum. Electron Ionization (EI) is a very energetic process resulting in molecular ions (M+•) that have a great deal of internal energy. EI is the most widely used type of ionization in GC/MS. One very important consideration about different ionization techniques is that switching between them may require that the vacuum be broken. The four types of m/z analyzers used in GC/MS are described: quadrupole mass filter (QMF) (most widely used), quadrupole ion trap (QIT), time of flight (TOF) and the double-focusing mass spectrometer (rarely used in most laboratories today). Finally, it discusses several considerations that must be made in setting up a full-spectrum acquisition mode.}
